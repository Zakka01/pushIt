## Description

Push_swap is a sorting project where you must order numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations, aiming to minimize the number of moves.
Efficiency matters because the program is graded by how few operations it produces, not by execution time.


## Instructions

1. The program takes a list of integers as arguments.
2. All numbers must be valid integers and **no duplicates are allowed & the integers must not exceed the max_int**.
3. The goal is to sort the numbers in **ascending order** in **Stack A**.
4. You are only allowed to use the predefined push_swap operations.
5. The program outputs the list of operations to standard output.
6. If the input is already sorted, the program prints nothing.
7. In case of invalid input, the program must print `Error` followed by new an '\n' on the standard error and exit.
